        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Sulaman, but I go by Sulay. I am a 22-year-old Computer Information Systems major at Bronx Community College, with plans to transfer to Baruch College to pursue a Business degree when I begin my final semester in Spring 2025. I have developed skills in IT support, web development, and customer service, and I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

This website serves as a showcase of my work, including various projects and assignments from my current IT courses. One of the featured projects is an MPG (Miles Per Gallon) calculator, which you can find next to the Home tab. Iâ€™ve personally used it, and I invite you to check it out to see how well it works!
